				<h3 id="professional-summary">Professional Summary</h3>
				<p>
					I am currently a teacher at Mossman State High School. Before this, I studied a Bachelor of Mathematics and Science (Physics) at Queensland University of Technology, and then completed my Masters of Teaching at Griffith University.
					<br><br>
					In my final years of uni, I developed a keen interest in medical mathematics and was lucky enough to become involved in varying research projects. You can see some of these projects below.
				</p>

				<h3 id="professional-development">Professional Development</h3>
				<p><a href="https://research.qut.edu.au/biofabrication/">Predictive Model for Aneurysm</a><br>
				<img src="img/gallery4.png" class="img-fluid" width = 50%></p>
				<p>
					In my final year of my math and physics degree, I worked with QUT's biofabrication and tissue morphology lab to create a predictive model for aneurysms. Although the specifications of this project are confidential there is a large potential for helping others through a combination of simulation and verification. This research has since been published, and can be accessed here: <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36604495/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36604495/</a>

				<p><a href="">Biased Migration of Chemotherapy</a><br>
				<img src="img/gallery1.jpg?raw=true" class="img-fluid"  width = 50%><br></p>
				<p>
					Over the summer of 2019/2020 I was fortunate enough to research the migration patterns of chemotherapy to better understand this process on a mathematical scale. Within this project I also simulated mechanisms to bias its migration, which is important as chemotherapy currently kills both malignant and healthy cells. My simulations had strong supporting evidence that to mitigate this we should invest in shielding techniques instead of changing chemotherapy itself.

				<p><a href="https://youtu.be/b_wwrg5Yfdg?t=89">Construction of MRI Interface</a><br>
				<img src="img/gallery2.png" class="img-fluid"  width = 70%><br></p>
				<p>
					Within my undergraduate classwork I have taken a keen interest to the operation of MRI. As an aspiring mathematician and physicist, I am able to pursue this from two disjoint yet complimentary perspectives. Truly, it is quantum physics that provides the theoretical framework for operation, but mathematics that allows for the extraction of this data in meaningful ways. Within this project I coded the interface of an MRI machine and was successfully able to digitally reconstruct the slice of the brain you see above.<br>

				<p><a href="">Temperature Spatial Analysis</a><br>
				<img src="img/gallery5.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
				<p>
					If you've ever touched your laptop after having it running for a while you'd correctly notice that it gets hot. Perhaps interestingly, this is a not a constant temperature. Some parts of the computer will be warmer (and cooler) than others. It is important to understand this distribution since not all computer components can operate at the same temperatures. In this project I analysed the temperature distribution of an electronic component and was able to deduce the global marketability for such a component.

				<p><a href="https://www.qut.edu.au/study/career-advisers-and-teachers/young-accelerators">STEM Ambassador</a><br>
				<img src="img/gallery3.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
				<p>
					As a STEM ambassador, I run workshops intended for audiences ranging upwards from 13 years. The purpose of this can be anywhere from the basics of coding or statistics, to the intricacies of time travel itself. I find this highly rewarding and bolsters my communicative abilities as a scientist. Truly, researchers must be able to communicate their findings to change the world so this is a skill and position I hold in high regard.

				<p><img src="img/other.png" class="img-fluid"></p>
				<p>
					Although academia is a large part of my life, it certainly doesn't stop here for me. Above all, my greatest passion is people. I see immeasurable value in community and do everything in my power to foster this. Whether it's hosting Sunday lunch, organising fitness groups or a Friday night at the local bowlsie, I am happy to go the extra mile to bring people together, and hopefully make them as happy as they make me. Outside of these, I spend any remaining time in the kitchen cooking or relaxing over some needed video games.
