			<h3 id="professional-summary">Professional Summary</h3>
			<p>
			I am currently in my third year of studying a Bachelor of Mathematics and Science (Physics) at Queensland University of Technology. If you were to ask my friends about me, I’d be described as an academically rigorous, devoted, and high aspiring student familiar with mathematics, technology, and customer interaction. My extroverted heart and mind also help me to connect with almost anyone in the room.
			<br><br>
			In my introductory and now upper-level coursework, I've developed a keen interest in medical mathematics and am extremely interested in pursuing research as both an undergraduate and postgraduate. This page therefore aims to illustrate my general competencies and also provide insight to some of my passions and interests. </p>

			<h3 id="professional-development">Professional Development</h3>
			<p><a href="https://research.qut.edu.au/biofabrication/">Predictive Model for Aneurysm</a>
			<br>
			<img src="images/VRES.jpg?raw=true"></p>
			<p> Over the following summer I will be studying within QUT's biofabrication and tissue morphology lab to create a predictive model for aneurysms. Although the specifications of this project are currently confidential there is a large potential for helping others through a combination of simulation and verification. There is hope that this project will directly benefit the lives of those suffering aneurysms. </p>

			<p><a href="/pdf/Poster.pdf">Biased Migration of Chemotherapy</a>
			<br>
			<img src="images/2019.jpg?raw=true">
			<br></p>
			<p> Over the summer of 2019/2020 I was fortunate enough to research the migration patterns of chemotherapy to better understand this process on a mathematical scale. Within this project I also simulated mechanisms to bias its migration, which is important as chemotherapy currently kills both malignant and healthy cells. My simulations had strong supporting evidence that to mitigate this we should invest in shielding techniques instead of changing chemotherapy itself. </p>

			<p><a href="https://youtu.be/b_wwrg5Yfdg?t=89">Construction of MRI Interface</a>
			<br>
			<img src="images/MRI.jpg?raw=true">
			<br></p>
			<p> Within my undergraduate classwork I have taken a keen interest to the operation of MRI. As an aspiring mathematician and physcist, I am able to pursue this from two disjoint yet complimentary perspectives. Truly, it is quantum physics that provides the theoretical framework for operation, but mathematics that allows for the extraction of this data in meaningful ways. Within this project I coded the interface of an MRI machine and was successfully able to digitally reconstruct the slice of the brain you see above.<br> <i>Acknowledgement to Evelyn Chen for her contribution on this task.</i></p>

			<p><a href="">Temperature Spatial Analysis</a>
			<br>
			<img src="images/temp4.jpg?raw=true"></p>
			<p> If you've ever touched your laptop after having it running for a while you'd correctly notice that it gets hot. Perhaps interestingly, this is a not a constant temperature. Some parts of the computer will be warmer (and cooler) than others. It is important to understand this distriubtion since not all computer components can operate at the same temperatures. In this project I analysed the temperature distribtuion of an electronic component and was able to deduce the global marketability for such a component.  </p>

			<p><a href="https://www.qut.edu.au/study/career-advisers-and-teachers/young-accelerators">STEM Ambassador</a>
			<br>
			<img src="images/amb.jpg?raw=true"></p>
			<p> As a STEM ambassador, I run workshops intended for audiences ranging upwards from 13 years. The purpose of this can be anywhere from the basics of coding or statistics, to the intricacies of time travel itself. I find this highly rewarding and bolsters my communicative abilities as a scientist. Truly, researchers must be able to communicate their findings to change the world so this is a skill and position I hold in high regard. </p>

			<hr>
			<h3 id="what-i-enjoy-outside-of-research">What I Enjoy Outside of Research</h3>
			<p><img src="images/col.jpg?raw=true"></p>
			<p> Although academia is a large part of my life, it certainly doesn't stop here for me. Above all, my greatest passion is people. I see immeasurable value in community and do everything in my power to foster this. Whether it's hosting sunday lunch, organising fitness groups or a friday night at the botanical bar (love for QUT), I am happy to go the extra mile to bring people together, and hopefully make them as happy as they make me. In addition to this, I've started calisthenics training to strengthen me mentally and physically. Outside of these, I spend any remaining time in the kitchen cooking or relaxing over some needed video games. </p>
